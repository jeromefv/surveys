Pages for state-based functions should include links to the corresponding object-oriented interface functions, and vice-versa.  It would be even better if matplotlib officially declared the object-oriented interface to be the ""current"" interface, and directed state-based function pages back to the object oriented ones.

*  ""External Resources"" should be organized better.  Some of them use the state interface and some use the object-oriented interface, and there's no obvious indication which is which if you don't know that they're different.  I'd recommend marking external resources based on experience level (e.g. for beginners, intermediate users, or advanced users), whether they use the state or OOP interface, and whether they're free or paid.

* Matplotlib should add many more comments to examples, should link to related examples, or should make them more like walkthroughs (see vignettes in R packages for a good example).  They are currently written in a way that makes it easy to copy and paste them for a particular use case, but I don't really understand why they work.  For example, in the page on custom scales (https://matplotlib.org/gallery/scales/scales.html), the mercator example has both NullFormatter and FixedLocator but I have no idea what they do or why I'd pick those functions over some of the alternatives.

* The list of third-party packages should be cleaned up a bit.  Some of them - like ggplot - haven't been updated in years so I wouldn't recommend using them.  I'd also move common extensions - like seaborn - to the top."

You can do anything with it.  That's part of the problem.  The commands are non-intuitive and the argument is so bloated there doesn't seem to be a single place that can describe it all succinctly.  I've worked with other Python plotting libraries that have easier, more intuitive APIs and cleaner default appearance, but always find myself not quite having the flexibility I need to do something that isn't standard, but still feels like it should be fairly straightforward.  It may very well be impossible, but to make one API that's clean and intuitive, but still provides you with all the low level flexibility, but it would be great to see the matplotlib docs try to hit the high notes more, clean some cruft out of the existing examples, and hit some more real world use cases."

Regarding the documentation - I think that what MPL's documentation mainly lacks is the lack of in-doc simple 2-3 lines of code graphical examples. Take the ""plot"" page for example - the fact that there aren't few embedded plotting examples is criminal. For example, it should have an example of changed coloring and line-width; another example of two lines with specific coloring and dashing; a third example with chaa changed cap, antialising, log-scaling and a basic transformation... etc.
The search in the attached *separate* examples looking for something as simple as adding a marker is exhausting. 

2. The second thing I want to mention is something that makes MPL increasingly less relevant today is the lack of out-of-the-box interactivity (such as zooming, panning, selecting points, etc.), and interactivity in general in the exploratory environment of Jupyter notebooks. I think you should consider adding a web-based/Jupyter-notebook-compatible backend.


Other than that, thank you for matplotlib! "
